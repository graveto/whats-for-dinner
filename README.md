# whats-for-dinner

App to help you with dinner plans. I collect recipe links. I have a few hundred of them now. It is difficult to just search the bookmarks. I need a way to be able to catogorize and search all the recipes that I have collected. This app is going to let me organize them.

Technologies:

1. React frontend
2. Node.js backend with Express and Graphql (version 2 will move the backend to Rust)
3. Mongodb

Plans:

1. Users can add new recipes either by entering them manually or by providing a link to the recipe.
2. Users will be able to edit the recipes.
3. Users will be able to catogize and rank the recipes.
4. Users will be able to search the recipes by title, category, rating, ingredients.
5. More fun stuff.
